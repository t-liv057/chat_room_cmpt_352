Running this app requires starting server.java and then running startClient.java with two arguments.  The first arguement is the IP address
of the server, and the second arguement is the username you wish to have inside the chatroom.  A GUI should appear for the chat client, there is no
GUI for server activity.

mainly the two arguments when running startClient.java are the most important to running and compiling the project.
